This is a Chrome Extension used to encode messages into images by formulaically and imperceptibly altering the RGB values of each pixel, allowing coherent sentences to be hidden in images and subsequently decoded. To encode, all that needs to be provided is a link to the image, the message you wish to encode, and an optional passcode for an additional layer of security. To decode, all one needs is a link to the image and a passcode, if there is one.

This was done during a 24 hour hackathon.
